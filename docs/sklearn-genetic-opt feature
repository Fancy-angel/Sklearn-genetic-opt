####Main Features:
 GASearchCV: Principal class of the package, holds the evolutionary cross-validation optimization routine.
Algorithms: Set of different evolutionary algorithms to use as an optimization procedure.
Callbacks: Custom evaluation strategies to generate early stopping rules, logging (into TensorBoard, .pkl files, etc) or your custom logic.
Plots: Generate pre-defined plots to understand the optimization process.
MLflow: Build-in integration with mlflow to log all the hyperparameters, cv-scores and the fitted models.
